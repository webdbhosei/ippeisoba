System Design Discussion

Day 6 of the course lecture, 
Object Oriented Web Design by Ruby language,
on 14/May/2015
Graduate School of Hosei University

Topics: Inivial View Design for 
"Problem Solving Engine"

Github Environment; 
students made clones on their PCs.

Springboard Table Design is shown.
Now discussed on how the system ask users to input the "Problems" and "comments"

----------- Discussion: ------
In case, someone want to register the problem:
"Cats are noisy,"
to obtain some "Solution" for this. 
Someone may want to write comment;
"Is this a problem?"  
Then, how he/she gives level of this problem?
Is this a "Fact?" 

According to one student's proposal, the table name "Fact" is not proper.
We should give the table name "Phenomenon" or "Events."

"Children are noisy." 
For someone irritated, this could be the fact. 

Problems are problems, for those who cannot ignore the "Facts" or the "Phenomena."

Now we should get into the next stage.

Design the first WEB screen by imaging a senario that: "one person fill in the form to upload a problem to the system," and the other person give comment, or evaluation of the problem level, or solutions.

By imaging the WEB screen, we may need to re-design the table structure, and schema of this Problem Solving Engine system.

Homework: just image and draw the WEB screens (simple rough schetch is enough,) and present your initial WEB view with the senario, how the system is used.
